## Installation

### Package Managers

#### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap matthewp/gitpal https://git.sr.ht/~matthewp/homebrew-gitpal
brew install gitpal
```

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Free Pascal Compiler (FPC)** 3.2.2 or later
- **OpenSSL 1.1.x** (required for HTTPS API calls)
- **CMake** 3.15 or later

#### macOS with Homebrew

```bash
brew install fpc cmake openssl@1.1
```

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get install fpc cmake libssl-dev
```

### Building

```bash
# Configure the build
cmake -S . -B build

# Build the project
cmake --build build

# Run the binary
./bin/gitpal --help
```

### Build Configuration

The project automatically detects and configures:

- **OpenSSL 1.1**: Required for HTTPS API calls to LLM providers
- **Vendor dependencies**: Includes bobaui (TUI) and models.pas (LLM client)

### Installing from Source

After building, you can install gitpal system-wide:

```bash
# Install to /usr/local/bin (default)
sudo cmake --install build

# Or install to a custom prefix
cmake --install build --prefix /usr/local

# Uninstall
sudo cmake --build build --target uninstall
```

## Setup

gitpal features an interactive setup wizard that runs automatically on first use. You can also run it anytime with `gitpal setup`.

### Quick Start

1. **Run the setup wizard**:
   ```bash
   gitpal setup
   ```

2. **Choose your AI provider**:
   - **OpenAI** - GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 models
   - **Claude** - Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Haiku
   - **Gemini** - Google's Gemini models

3. **Authenticate**:
   - **API Key**: Enter your API key or use environment variables
     - OpenAI: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - Claude: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
     - Gemini: `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **OAuth** (Claude only): Sign in with your Claude Pro/Max account

4. **Select your model**: Choose from available models for your provider

### Using gitpal

Once configured, using gitpal is simple:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Generate commit message
gitpal commit
```

## Usage

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Run interactive setup wizard (automatically runs on first use)
gitpal setup

# During setup you can:
# - Choose your AI provider (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
# - Enter API keys or use OAuth (Claude only)
# - Select your preferred model
```

### Generating Commit Messages

```bash
# Generate commit message for staged changes
gitpal commit

# Automatically stage all changes and generate commit message
gitpal commit --stage

# Add custom instructions to guide the AI
gitpal commit --prompt "Focus on the API refactoring"

# Use a different provider for this commit
gitpal commit --provider claude
```

### Updating Changelog

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since last tag
gitpal changelog

# Generate changelog for a specific version range
gitpal changelog --from v1.0.0 --to v2.0.0

# Use a specific provider
gitpal changelog --provider openai
```

### Recovering from Git Mistakes

```bash
# Interactive recovery from recent git operations
gitpal undo

# Provide context to help AI analyze your specific situation
gitpal undo --prompt "I messed up the rebase"

# Use a specific provider for operation analysis
gitpal undo --provider claude
```

**What gitpal undo can help with:**
- Accidentally ran `git reset --hard` and lost commits
- Botched a rebase and want to go back to the previous state
- Deleted a branch by mistake
- Merged the wrong branch and need to undo it
- Lost commits during complex git operations

**Safety features:**
- Creates automatic backup branches before any recovery
- Shows detailed impact analysis before making changes
- Risk assessment with visual indicators (ðŸŸ¢ LOW, ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM, ðŸ”´ HIGH)
- AI-powered explanations of what each operation will do
- Requires confirmation for all recovery operations

### Recovering Orphaned Commits

```bash
# Find and recover commits that are no longer reachable from any branch
gitpal recover

# Describe what you're looking for to help AI group related commits
gitpal recover --prompt "lost my work on user authentication"

# Use a specific provider for commit analysis
gitpal recover --provider claude
```

### Understanding Git Operations

```bash
# Analyze recent git operations and get AI-powered explanations
gitpal explain

# Use a specific provider for analysis
gitpal explain --provider claude
```

**What gitpal explain can help with:**
- Understanding what happened during complex rebases or merges
- Analyzing the impact of git operations on your repository
- Getting context for unexpected repository states
- Learning from git operations to improve your workflow
- Debugging issues after complex git operations

**Analysis includes:**
- **Before/after states**: Shows repository state before and after operations
- **Operation timeline**: Recent git operations in chronological order
- **Impact analysis**: What changed and why
- **AI explanations**: Plain English explanations of complex git operations

**What gitpal recover can help with:**
- Commits lost during force pushes or branch deletions
- Work that got "lost" during complex rebases or merges
- Experiments that were discarded but are now needed
- Commits from deleted branches that contain valuable work
- Orphaned commits from interrupted git operations

**Recovery process:**
1. **Analysis**: Scans git reflog to find orphaned commits
2. **AI Grouping**: Groups related commits into logical units
3. **Plan Generation**: Creates detailed recovery plan with git commands
4. **User Confirmation**: Shows exactly what will happen before execution
5. **Safe Execution**: Creates backup branches and executes recovery

**Recovery options:**
- **Create new branch**: Recover commits to a new branch for safe inspection
- **Cherry-pick to current**: Apply commits directly to your current branch
- **Show diffs**: Examine the actual code changes before deciding

**Safety features:**
- Automatic backup branches created before any changes
- Detailed preview of all git commands that will be executed
- Cherry-pick conflict handling with automatic rollback
- AI-powered risk assessment and impact analysis

### Global Options

```bash
# Show help for any command
gitpal --help
gitpal commit --help
gitpal undo --help
gitpal recover --help
gitpal explain --help

# Show version
gitpal --version
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### OpenSSL Errors
If you encounter SSL/TLS errors when connecting to AI providers:
- **macOS**: Install OpenSSL 1.1 with `brew install openssl@1.1`
- **Linux**: Ensure `libssl-dev` is installed
- FreePascal 3.2.2 requires OpenSSL 1.1.x (not 3.0+)

#### No Editor Opens
If the edit feature doesn't work:
- Set your preferred editor: `export EDITOR=vim`
- gitpal checks for `$EDITOR`, `$VISUAL`, then common editors

#### API Key Not Found
- Run `gitpal setup` to reconfigure
- Check environment variables are exported (not just set)
- Ensure no trailing spaces in API keys

#### Commit Message Not Applied
- Ensure you have staged changes before running `gitpal commit`
- Use `gitpal commit --stage` to automatically stage all changes

#### OAuth Login Issues (Claude)
- Requires active Claude Pro or Max subscription
- Clear cookies/cache if login fails
- Fallback to API key method if needed

#### Undo Command Issues
- **"Repository not clean"**: Commit or stash changes before running `gitpal undo`
- **"No reflog entries found"**: Repository might be new or reflog might be disabled
- **"Operation not found"**: The operation you're looking for might be too old (only shows recent 50 entries)
- **Authentication errors**: Ensure your AI provider is configured with `gitpal setup`

#### Recover Command Issues
- **"No orphaned commits found"**: All commits are reachable from existing branches
- **"Cherry-pick conflicts"**: Resolved automatically with rollback to original state
- **"Branch creation failed"**: Ensure you have permission to create branches
- **"Backup branch exists"**: Previous backup branch exists, will use timestamped name
- **"Git repository not found"**: Run the command from within a git repository

#### Explain Command Issues
- **"No reflog entries found"**: Repository might be new or reflog might be disabled
- **"Analysis incomplete"**: AI provider may be unavailable or rate-limited
- **"Git repository not found"**: Run the command from within a git repository
- **"Permission denied"**: Ensure you have read access to the git repository
